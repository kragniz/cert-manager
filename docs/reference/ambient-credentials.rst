===================
Ambient Credentials
===================

Some API clients are able to infer credentials to use from the environment they run within.
Notably, this includes cloud instance-metadata stores and environment variables.
In cert-manager, the term 'ambient credentials' refers to such credentials.
They are always drawn from the environment of the 'cert-manager-controller' deployment.

*************
Example Usage
*************

If cert-manager is deployed in an environment with ambient AWS credentials, such as with a `kube2iam <https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam>`_ role,
the following ClusterIssuer would make use of those credentials to perform the ACME dns challenge with route53.

.. code-block: yaml

    apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      acme:
        server: https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        email: user@example.com
        privateKeySecretRef:
          name: letsencrypt-prod
        dns01:
          providers:
          - name: route53
            route53:
              region: us-east-1

It is important to note that the ``route53`` section does not specify any ``accessKeyID`` or ``secretAccessKeySecretRef``.
If either of these are specified, ambient credentials will not be used.

*********************************
When are Ambient Credentials used
*********************************

Ambient credentials are supported for the 'route53' ACME dns01 provider.

They will only be used if no credentials are supplied, even if the supplied credentials are incorrect.

By default, they may be used by ClusterIssuers, but not regular issuers.
The ``--issuer-ambient-credentials`` and ``--cluster-issuer-ambient-credentials=false``
flags on the cert-manager may be used to override this behavior.

Note that ambient credentials are disabled for regular Issuers by default
to ensure unprivileged users who may create issuers
cannot issue certificates using any credentials cert-manager incidentally has access to.
